🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning

A simple deep learning project that recognizes handwritten digits with high accuracy using Python and TensorFlow.

This project implements a Handwritten Digit Recognition System using Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9).

The system uses a Neural Network built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits with high accuracy (~98%).
